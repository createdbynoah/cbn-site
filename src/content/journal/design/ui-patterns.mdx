# UI Patterns I Keep Coming Back To

After building enough interfaces, you start recognizing the same handful of patterns that just _work_. Not flashy, not trendy — just reliable. Here are the ones I reach for most.

## Pill filters

A horizontal row of small rounded buttons that filter content in-place. No page reload, no dropdown, no checkbox forest. You see them on this site's journal page — tap a category, the list updates.

Why they work:
- **All options visible** at a glance
- **Single interaction** to filter
- **Zero learning curve** — it's just buttons
- Works on touch and desktop equally well

The trick is keeping the pill count low. If you have more than 6–8 categories, switch to a dropdown or search.

## Card grids with hover lift

Cards with a subtle `translateY(-4px)` on hover. That's it. No flip animations, no parallax, no 3D transforms. Just a tiny lift that says "this is interactive."

Pair it with a border-color transition (`rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` → `0.14`) and you've got a tactile feel without any performance cost.

## Monospace metadata

Dates, reading times, tag labels — anything that's _about_ the content rather than _the_ content itself — rendered in a monospace font at a smaller size. It creates a clear visual hierarchy between the headline, the description, and the meta details.

## Staggered entrance animations

When a page loads, cards animate in one after another with incremental `transition-delay`. The first card appears immediately, the second 120ms later, the third 240ms later. Feels alive without being slow.

The key is keeping individual delays under 600ms total and respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Dark backgrounds with warm accents

A near-black background (`#0b0a08`) with amber (`#ffb454`) and coral (`#ff6b4a`) accents. The warmth offsets the darkness and feels more inviting than the cold blue-on-black that's everywhere.

## What I avoid

- **Carousels** — people don't scroll them
- **Hamburger menus on desktop** — just show the links
- **Scroll hijacking** — let the browser do its job
- **Toast notifications for non-errors** — just update the UI directly

These patterns aren't original. They're just the ones that hold up over time.
