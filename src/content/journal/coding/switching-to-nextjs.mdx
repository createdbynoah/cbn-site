# Why I Switched to Next.js 15

After years of hand-rolling HTML and tweaking build scripts, I finally bit the bullet and migrated my portfolio to **Next.js 15** with the App Router. Here's why — and how it went.

## The tipping point

Static site generators are great until you need MDX, image optimization, and proper routing all at once. I was juggling too many bespoke scripts. Next.js gave me all of it out of the box.

Here's a great walkthrough that convinced me to make the jump:

## The migration process

The biggest lift was converting my flat HTML pages into the App Router's file-based routing. But once I had the layout shell in place, everything else snapped together fast.

### Key decisions

1. **Static export** — I don't need a server. `output: 'export'` gives me a folder of HTML I can drop on Cloudflare Pages.
2. **MDX for content** — Writing posts in Markdown with JSX components is the sweet spot between authoring comfort and flexibility.
3. **Zod schemas** — Frontmatter validation at build time catches mistakes before they ship.

### Try it yourself

Here's a minimal Next.js 15 App Router setup you can explore:

## What I'd do differently

If I started over, I'd set up the content layer _first_ — schemas, readers, MDX pipeline — before touching any UI. Getting the data model right early makes everything downstream simpler.

## Wrapping up

The migration took a weekend of focused work. The result is a site that's faster to build, easier to maintain, and more fun to write for. If you're on the fence about Next.js 15, I'd say go for it.
