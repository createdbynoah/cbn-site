# Building an MDX Embed Suite

One of the first things I wanted after setting up MDX was a clean way to embed rich media. No third-party scripts, no layout shift, no cookie banners. Here's the system I landed on.

## The components

### YouTube — privacy-enhanced

The `YouTubeEmbed` component uses `youtube-nocookie.com` so no tracking cookies are set until the viewer actually plays the video.

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="jNQXAC9IVRw" title="Me at the zoo — the first YouTube video" />

You use it like this in your `.mdx` file:

```mdx
<YouTubeEmbed videoId="jNQXAC9IVRw" title="Me at the zoo" />
```

The `startAt` prop lets you skip to a specific timestamp (in seconds):

```mdx
<YouTubeEmbed videoId="jNQXAC9IVRw" startAt="5" title="Skipping ahead" />
```

### Tweets — no JavaScript required

The `TweetEmbed` renders a styled card with the tweet content you provide via props. No Twitter/X embed script, no iframe, no client-side fetch. Just static HTML.

<TweetEmbed
  tweetId="20"
  author="Jack Dorsey"
  handle="@jack"
  content="just setting up my twttr"
  date="Mar 21, 2006"
/>

Usage:

```mdx
<TweetEmbed
  tweetId="20"
  author="Jack Dorsey"
  handle="@jack"
  content="just setting up my twttr"
  date="Mar 21, 2006"
/>
```

All fields except `tweetId` are optional — but filling them in makes the card useful without requiring any API calls.

### CodeSandbox — interactive playgrounds

Drop a live code editor right into your post:

<CodeSandbox sandboxId="new" view="split" title="Try it live" />

Supports three view modes:
- `editor` — just the code
- `preview` — just the output
- `split` — side by side (the default)

```mdx
<CodeSandbox sandboxId="new" view="split" />
```

### Generic iframe — for everything else

The `IframeEmbed` is the foundation component. Use it for anything that has a URL:

<IframeEmbed
  src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio"
  title="MDN: aspect-ratio"
  aspectRatio="4/3"
/>

```mdx
<IframeEmbed
  src="https://example.com"
  title="Example"
  aspectRatio="4/3"
  maxWidth="600px"
/>
```

## Design decisions

- **No client-side JS** for tweets — static cards are faster and respect privacy
- **`aspect-ratio` CSS** instead of the padding-bottom hack — cleaner and well-supported now
- **`youtube-nocookie.com`** — privacy-enhanced mode by default
- **Dark theme** for CodeSandbox embeds to match the site

## Standard images

Regular markdown images still work exactly as expected:

Store images in `public/assets/journal/` and reference them with absolute paths.
